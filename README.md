## Cloudflare Setup Guide

Before using this tool, you'll need a Cloudflare account and domain. Follow these steps:

### 1. Register a Domain

If you don't already have a domain:

1. Purchase a domain from any domain registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. We recommend choosing a domain registrar based on price and their ease of changing nameservers

### 2. Add Domain to Cloudflare

1. Create a [Cloudflare account](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up) if you don't have one
2. Log in to Cloudflare and click "Add a Site"
3. Enter your domain name and click "Add Site"
4. Select a plan (the Free plan works fine for this tool)
5. Cloudflare will scan for existing DNS records

### 3. Update Nameservers

1. Cloudflare will provide you with nameservers (e.g., `cruz.ns.cloudflare.com` and `tim.ns.cloudflare.com`)
2. Go to your domain registrar's website
3. Find the nameserver settings for your domain
4. Replace the current nameservers with Cloudflare's nameservers
5. Save the changes (propagation can take up to 24 hours)

### 4. Create API Tokens

For the most secure setup, create dedicated API tokens:

1. Go to your [Cloudflare dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Navigate to "My Profile" ‚Üí "API Tokens"
3. Click "Create Token"
4. Choose "Create Custom Token"
5. Give your token a name (e.g., "Caddy DNS Token")
6. Under "Permissions", add:
   - Zone - DNS - Edit
7. Under "Zone Resources", select:
   - Include - Specific zone - Your domain
8. Click "Continue to Summary" and then "Create Token"
9. Copy the token value (you won't be able to see it again!)

## Usage

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Initialize configuration
caddy-cloudflare init
```

Follow the interactive prompts to configure your Cloudflare credentials and domain.

### Install Caddy

```bash
# Install Caddy locally
caddy-cloudflare install

# Or install Caddy system-wide (requires sudo)
sudo caddy-cloudflare install --system
```

### Deploy a Service

```bash
# Deploy with interactive prompts
caddy-cloudflare deploy

# Deploy with specific options
caddy-cloudflare deploy --subdomain myapp --port 3000

# Using a custom IP (instead of auto-detection)
caddy-cloudflare deploy --ip 203.0.113.1
```

### Manage Deployments

```bash
# List all deployments
caddy-cloudflare list

# Show all DNS records (not just deployments)
caddy-cloudflare list --all

# Delete a deployment
caddy-cloudflare delete myapp
```

### Proxy Management

```bash
# Start the Caddy proxy
caddy-cloudflare proxy start

# Check proxy status
caddy-cloudflare proxy status

# Stop the proxy
caddy-cloudflare proxy stop

# Reload proxy configuration
caddy-cloudflare proxy reload
```

### Troubleshooting

```bash
# Run diagnostic checks
caddy-cloudflare debug
```

## Advanced Usage

### Using Environment Variables

You can use environment variables instead of storing credentials in config files:

```bash
# API Token method (recommended)
export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"

# Least privilege method (recommended)
export CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_TOKEN="your-zone-token"
export CLOUDFLARE_DNS_TOKEN="your-dns-token"

# Global API key method (legacy)
export CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY="your-global-api-key"
export CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"

# Domain configuration
export CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN="yourdomain.com"
```
